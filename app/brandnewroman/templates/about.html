      Brand New Roman is the most corporate Corporate Font ever created! Now all your content can be sponsored content, and sponsored by everybody!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, If youâ€™re sponsored by everybody, are you really sponsored by nobody?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download Brand New Roman for free as a colored or regular monochrome font. <a href="https://www.colorfonts.wtf" target="_blank" class="ga" ga_id="about-color-fonts-link">Color fonts</a> are still relatively new and are thus far only supported in Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign CC 2018+. They display in Firefox and Edge; Safari support is coming in September.
